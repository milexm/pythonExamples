# Name: lists.py
# Show how to use lists.
# Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together 
# other values.
# The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of 
# comma-separated values (items)
# between square brackets.
# Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have 
# the same type.
# For more information, see
# [[http://https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/list/|Python List]]


def listIndex():
    # Perform basic index operations.

    # Define a list.
    my_list = ['p', 'r', 'o', 'b', 'e']

    # At index 0 is : p
    print("At index 0 is : " + my_list[0])

    # At index 2 is : o
    print("At index 2 is : " + my_list[2])

    # At index 4 is : e
    print("At index 4 is : " + my_list[4])

    # Error!
    # List indices must be integers or slices, not float
    # my_list[4.0]

    # Created nested list
    n_list = ["Happy", [2, 0, 1, 5]]

    # Nested indexing

    # In the nested list at index 0,1 is : a
    print("In the nested list at index 0, 1 is : " + n_list[0][1])

    # In the nested list at index 1,3 is : 5
    print("In the nested list at index 1,3 is : " + str((n_list[1][3])))

    # Negative indexing
    # The index -1 refers to the last element
    # The index -5 refers to the first element (in this example)

    # At index -1 is : e
    print("At index -1 is : " + my_list[-1])

    # At index -5 is : p
    print("At index -5 is : " + my_list[-5])


def listSlice():
    # Perform list slicing.
    # Slicing can be best visualized by considering
    # the index to be between the elements as shown below.
    #
    #0___1___2___3___4___5___6___7___8___9
    #|P  |R  |O  |G  |R  |A  |M  |I  |Z  |
    #-9 -8  -7  -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1
    #
    # So if we want to access a range, we need two index
    # that will slice that portion from the list.

    my_list = ['p', 'r', 'o', 'g', 'r', 'a', 'm', 'i', 'z']

    # elements beginning to end
    print("All list elements: " + str(my_list[:]))

    # elements 3rd to 5th
    print("3rd to 5th element: " +  str(my_list[2:5]))

    # elements beginning to 4th
    print("1st to 4th element: " + str(my_list[:-5]))

    # elements 6th to end
    print("6th to end element: " + str(my_list[5:]))


def listChange():
    # Change elements in a list.
    # Note: List are mutable, meaning, their elements can be changed
    # unlike string or tuple.

    # Define a list
    my_list = [2, 4, 6, 8]

    # Display elements beginning to end
    result = '{0} {1}'.format('All list items: ', str(my_list[:]))
    print(result)

    # Change the first item
    my_list[0] = 1
    result = '{0} {1}'.format('Changed first item: ', str(my_list[:]))
    print(result)

    # Change 2nd to 4th items
    my_list[1:4] = [3, 5, 7]
    result = '{0} {1}'.format('Changed 2nd to 4th items: ', str(my_list[:]))
    print(result)

def listAdd():
    # Add elements to a lis.

    # Define a list
    my_list = [1, 3, 5]
    result = '{0} {1}'.format('All list items: ', str(my_list[:]))
    print(result)

    # Add an element to the list
    my_list.append(7)
    result = '{0} {1}'.format('Added one item to the list: ', str(my_list[:]))
    print(result)

    # Add several elements to the list
    my_list.extend([9, 11, 13])
    result = '{0} {1}'.format('Added several elements to the list: ', 
              str(my_list[:]))
    print(result)
