Module name: Tuple.py

Note: Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as list.The only difference 
is that tuples are immutable. Tuples once created cannot be modified.
Tuples are used to write-protect data and are usually faster than list as 
it cannot change dynamically. It is defined within parentheses () where 
items are separated by commas.
